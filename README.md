# TimeSwift
A sleek, simple and private timekeeping website. Simple and easy to use, your privacy is kept safe with no invasive ads or trackers.

TimeSwift is a timekeeping website with the aims of being private, swift and simple. Listed below are how these things have been achieved:

## Private
We don't use Google Analytics or Google Ads and instead use Matomo (an open-source, privacy respecting alternative to GA) and currently don't use any ads (although will use privacy-respecting ones if we choose to ad adverts in the future). We also don't collect any data.

## Speed
Our website is fast as we don't have to load in cookies or trackers and we've cut down slowness as much as possible throughout our site.

## Simple
We use a mix of simple website navigation, easy to use features and a darker colour palette to make TimeSwift as easy to use (and easy on the eyes) as possible.
