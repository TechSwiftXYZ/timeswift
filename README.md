# TimeSwift
TimeSwift is a timekeeping website with the aims of being private, swift and simple. Listed below are how these things have been achieved:

## Private
We don't use Google Analytics or Google Ads and instead use Matomo (an open-source, privacy respecting alternative to GA) and currently don't use any ads (although will use privacy-respecting ones if we choose to ad adverts in the future). We also don't collect any data.

## Speed
Our website is fast as we don't have to load in cookies or trackers and we've cut down slowness as much as possible throughout our site.

## Simple
We use a mix of simple website navigation, easy to use features and a darker colour palette to make TimeSwift as easy to use (and easy on the eyes) as possible.

## Website URL
TimeSwift can be found at https://time.techswift.xyz. We own the base techswift.xyz link but we are yet to build a project on it but the link is safe and owned by us.

## Extra License Info
This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 license. Details of the license can be found at https://github.com/TechSwiftXYZ/timeswift/blob/main/LICENSE. Although this isn't mandatory nor protected under the license, we kindly ask that if you are to use our code, you modify it as opposed to completely copying it.

Some of our images are from third parties and so their images might use a different license or follow different restrictions. Namely we use Pixabay for stock images and Flagpedia for flag images.

IMPORTANT: If you are to use our code, please remove the Matomo analytics code found in the <head> section of every page or else the analytics of your website/project will be sent to us, not you.

### Note
We aren't affilated with the TimeSwift project at https://github.com/jmpg93/TimeSwift, nor do we use them for the time features on our website.
